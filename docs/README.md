# Source Control

Git is a distributed VCS (Version Control System), also referred to as a SCM (Source Code Management) tool. It is designed for tracking changes in source code and other text-based files.

## High-level concepts

```mermaid
%%{init: {'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark'}}%%
graph RL
    subgraph Local Machine
        WD[Working Directory] -- add --> SA[Staging area]
        SA -- reset --> WD
        SA -- commit --> LR[(Local Repository)]
        LR -.-> WD
    end
    subgraph Remote Server
        RR[(Remote Repository)] -- pull --> WD
        RR -- clone --> LR
        LR -- push --> RR
        RR -- fetch --> LR
    end

```

### **Working Directory**

The Working Directory, or work tree, is the directory on your local machine where you carry out your work.

It contains the project files and directories, along with git configuration files. When you modify files in your working dir, Git tracks those changes, which you can later add to the staging area, and then commit to the repository.

> [!TIP|label:Common Actions]
> - View a list of changed files -> `git status`
> - See the difference between the original file and working copy -> `git diff <filename>`
> - Remove a file from the working directory and stage the removal -> `git rm <filename>`

### **Staging Area**

The Staging Area, or index, is an intermediate area where Git collects changes before they are committed to the local repository. When you make changes in your Working Directory and decide you want to include them in your next commit, you add these changes to the Staging Area using `git add`.

The Staging Area allows you to group changes before creating a commit. This can be useful for organizing your commits and making sure they only include relevant changes.

> [!TIP|label:Common Actions]
> - View changes in the staging area -> `git status`
> - Add specific file to the staging area -> `git add <filename>`
> - Remove a file from the staging area -> `git reset <filename>`
> - Add *all* changes from PWD downwards -> `git add .`
> - Remove *all* changes from the staging area -> `git reset`
> - Remove a file from the working directory and stage the removal -> `git rm <filename>`

### **Local Repo**

The Local Repository is the .git directory inside your project's root directory. It contains all the project history, including all committed changes. When you commit changes from the Staging Area, they are saved in the Local Repository.

The Local Repository allows you to work independently of the Remote Repository, enabling you to commit changes, review history, and manage branches on your local machine.

> [!TIP|label:Common Actions]
> - Commit changes to the local repo -> `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
> - View commit history -> `git log`

### **Remote Repo**

The Remote Repository is a version of your project that is hosted on a remote server, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It allows multiple collaborators to share their work and keep their changes synchronized.

You can push your local commits to the Remote Repository and pull changes from it to keep your Local Repository up-to-date. This setup facilitates collaboration and backup of your project.

> [!TIP|label:Common Actions]
> - Push changes to the remote repo -> `git push`
> - Pull changes from the remote repo -> `git pull`
> - Fetch changes from the remote repo -> `git fetch`

> [!NOTE]
> **Difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`**:
> - `git fetch` downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch. It updates your remote tracking branches, allowing you to review changes before integrating them.
> - `git pull` is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`. It downloads the latest changes from the remote repository and immediately attempts to merge them into your current branch.

## Branching

Branches in Git are a useful way to work on different versions of a project simultaneously. A branch allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work without affecting the main line.

### **What is a Branch?**

A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. When you start making commits, youâ€™re working on a branch. You can create, delete, and switch between branches to manage different features, bug fixes, or experiments in your codebase.

I prefer to use `trunk` as my primary branch, with `develop` used as a buffer in an effort to ensure `trunk` is never broken. By having `develop` I give myself and opportunity to spot errors during due-diligence checks once I've merged a development branch, prior to merging `develop` to `trunk`.


### **Why Use Branches?**

Branches allow you to:
- Work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
- Collaborate with others by working on separate branches.
- Keep your main branch stable while working on potentially disruptive changes.
- Test new ideas safely without the risk of breaking the main project.

### **Common Branching Actions**

> [!TIP|label:Common Actions]
> - Create a new branch -> `git branch <branch-name>`
> - Switch to a branch -> `git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>`
> - Create and switch to a new branch -> `git checkout -b <branch-name>` or `git switch -c <branch-name>`
> - List all branches -> `git branch` or `git branch -a` (includes remote branches)
> - Merge a branch into the current branch -> `git merge <branch-name>`
> - Delete a branch -> `git branch -d <branch-name>` (use `-D` to force delete if necessary)

### **Branching Workflow Example**

Below is a simple example of a branching workflow visualized using a mermaid diagram. This shows creating a new branch called `develop`, making commits on both `trunk` (main branch) and `develop`, and then merging `develop` back into `trunk`.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true, 'mainBranchName':'trunk'}}}%%
gitGraph TB:
    commit id:"Initial Commit"
    branch develop
    commit
    commit
    checkout trunk
    merge develop
    checkout develop
    commit
    commit
```
